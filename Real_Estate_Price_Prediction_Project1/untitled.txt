1. Data analysing 

2. Data clearing

   drop null points using dropnna
   remove unnecessary columns 
   organise 'size' column bhk and bedroom into only number
   ornaise total_sqft into float and if range is there then convert into average
   make another column 'price per sqft'
   for less than 10 houses at a locations - convert all such locations into others
   
3. Outlier removal

   remove rows which have' total area per bhk < 300'
   at each location organise 'price per sqft' using mean and standard deviation
